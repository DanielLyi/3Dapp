Project to make a pseudo - 3D engine on Java Swing

In this app I want to make a Swing-based 3D engine that will show different 3D shapes by projecting them onto a plane. 

It's fully made in Java for practice. 

You can contribute to this project!

The Java style is based on the default IntelliJ Idea  Java code cleanup style.

All the questions or issues are accepted.
